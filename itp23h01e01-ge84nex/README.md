# H01E01 - Space Competition

In this exercise, we will implement basic user input reading as well as logging statements into the console.

Eran and Jasper have landed today with their spaceship on Mars to join a Martian competition. Earthlings have also been invited, although they are only half as fast as Martians. Nevertheless, Eran and Jasper want to give everything there, because the Earth has a reputation on their shoulders. We need you to help Eran and Jasper to gain a good reputation in the galaxy. There are three different tasks for the competition:

1. parkrun
2. pole vault
3. swimming

## Project Structure

In the template repository folder src/de/in/tum/ase you can find a file called SpaceCompetition.java, which is the only file you have to change in order to complete this exercise. In this file, you will find the class SpaceCompetition, in which you will have to implement the main method by replacing the TODO comments (//TODO: ...) with your lines of code.

## Your Tasks

**1. Print the welcome message**

First, help our Earthlings greet all the Martians warmly when they arrive. Print the following welcome message on the console:

 `Welcome Martians, We are Eran and Jasper from Earth!`

**2. Ask and print first choice**

After that, the first competition begins. Eran and Jasper can decide what they want to do first. For us to know what Eran and Jasper want to do first, we need their input. They can choose tasks above in any order. Therefore, ask for the name of the first choice from the console and print it on the console as below:

 `What is your first choice?`
 `-> parkrun`
 `First choice: parkrun.`

**3. Ask and print second choice**

Ask the name of the second choice from the console and print it on the console as below:

 `What is your second choice?`
 `-> swimming`
 `Second choice: swimming.`

**4. Ask and print third choice**

Ask the name of the third choice from the console and print it on the console as below:

 `What is your third choice?`
 `-> pole vault`
 `Third choice: pole vault.`

**5. Print choices all together**

Print out the order in which Eran and Jasper will compete for the competition on the console, e.g.:

 `Jasper and Eran will start with parkrun, continue with swimming, and end with pole vault.`

**6. Print the goodbye message**

After completing all three tasks, Eran and Jasper feel great that they were part of the Martian competition. Because of that, they want to thank all Martians. Therefore print goodbye messages on the console:

 `We were pleased to be part of your Martian competition.`
 `We will come again next year!`

Note: Don’t worry if you don’t get the total points after passing all 5 test cases, more tests will be executed after the deadline (hidden tests). Such hidden tests will also be part of the future exercises without explicitly addressing them within the problem statement. However, make sure you implement the exercise described in the problem statement correctly by executing your program locally.
